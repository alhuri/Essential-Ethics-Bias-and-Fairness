# Essential-Ethics-Bias-and-Fairness
As more AI technologies enter our daily lives and reach larger crowds throughout the world, we must fully grasp the vulnerabilities that trained machine learning models might show based on the data utilized during production. **“*It is more important to ensure that decisions that have been taken using AI are not reflecting discriminatory behavior towards a set of populations. It is important to take fairness into consideration while consuming the output from AI*.”** A quote from **-**The Guardian

Fairness and bias are among the most debated ethical problems surrounding machine learning systems. In recent years, there has been a strong emphasis on developing machine learning systems that are responsible and ethical in some sense. The terms "Ethics," "Bias," "Fairness," and "Explainability" appear frequently, but their meanings are sometimes ambiguous, and they are generally misinterpreted to indicate the same thing. This Lightning Talk seeks to clarify that.
